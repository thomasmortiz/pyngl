# TODO Use this class to design a treatment process for a raw gas stream
# This class will remove water, CO2, and H2S and return a MaterialStream
# suitable for running through the fractionation process, which assumes a treated stream
# Perhaps extend MaterialStream to handle both untreated and treated streams
# Should residue and liquids also be MaterialStreams?  That would be more
# process simulator-like
